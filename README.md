## About the Video Course
Vue.js is an open source JavaScript library for building modern, interactive web applications. With a rapidly growing community and a strong ecosystem, Vue.js makes developing complex, single-page applications a breeze. Its component-based approach, intuitive API, blazingly fast core, and compact size make Vue.js a great solution with which to craft your next front-end application.
This video tutorial dives right into exploring various tasks that you will come across while building your web applications with Vue.js. You start with building a simple Vue application, and then learn to add different elements, filters, properties, and forms to your project. You'll explore the different transitions and animations possible with Vue.js, and add components and events to your Vue application, making it more dynamic as you go. After that, you'll learn how to add communication with remote resources to your Vue application and leverage VueRouter 2 to build a single-page application. Finally, you will delve into advanced state management with Vuex and learn to test the applications you've built.
By the end of this course, you'll be ready to take on real-world projects with Vue, armed with the solutions needed to face development tasks head-on.
